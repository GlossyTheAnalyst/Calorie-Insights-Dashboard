# Calorie-Insights-Dashboard

## Introduction

The Calorie Insights Dashboard is a data visualization project built using Power BI to explore the relationship between daily calorie intake and key demographic and lifestyle factors. With increasing attention on health and wellness, this dashboard provides valuable insights into how different age groups, working conditions, sleep hours, and gender influence average daily calorie needs.

This project seeks to support health researchers, fitness enthusiasts, and policymakers in making informed decisions about calorie consumption patterns and lifestyle habits.

## Insights

### 1. Average Calorie Consumption:
* The overall average daily calorie intake across all respondents is 2,306 kcal.
### 2. Top Working Type:
* Individuals engaged in manual labor record the highest calorie consumption at 2,829 kcal, likely due to the physically demanding nature of their work.
### 3. Gender-Based Comparison:
* Males consume more calories on average (2,387 kcal) than females (2,225 kcal).
* This trend is consistent across different working types and age groups.
### 4. Sleep and Calorie Intake:
* The average sleep duration is 6.94 hours.
* There is no clear linear relationship between sleep hours and calorie intake, suggesting other contributing factors.
### 5. Age-Based Patterns:
* The 25–30 age group records the highest average daily calorie consumption at 2,434 kcal.
* Calorie needs tend to decline gradually with age.
### 6. Height by Gender:
* Slightly more males (51%) than females (49%) are represented in the dataset.

## Observations

* Manual laborers and healthcare workers consistently show higher calorie needs, reflecting the physical demands of their roles.
* Unemployed and retired individuals display lower average calorie requirements.
* Younger age groups (25–35) exhibit the highest caloric consumption, which may be attributed to metabolic rates and active lifestyles.
* Sleep duration varies, but low and high extremes do not always correlate with higher or lower caloric intake, indicating a complex interaction between rest and metabolism.
* Males consistently outpace females in terms of calorie requirements across all categories.

## Recommendations

* Nutritional programs should consider occupation and age when designing dietary plans, especially for physically active groups like manual laborers.
* Health campaigns should target younger age groups to promote balanced diets as they tend to consume more calories, potentially leading to overconsumption.
* Employers and wellness coaches can use such dashboards to tailor health routines based on job demands.
* Future data collection should include other lifestyle factors such as physical activity, diet types, and BMI for more granular analysis.
